# Introduction

`<-- INSERT SITE IMAGE -->`

For the final project in the Code Institute course, I wanted to create something personal and important to me and my future as a Software Developer. I have been a hugely creative individual
my whole life, and have worked in the past as a freelance Graphic Designer and Digital Marketer through the moniker of **Robert Clark Design**. I decided that I wanted to build this final project 
into a portfolio of my work and a place where I can sell my design and development services.

# User Experience

## Project Goals

**Robert Clark Design** is a full stack website that showcases a portfolio of design and development projects. The purpose is to demonstrate the work and skillset of the site user in an inviting
and stylish way in order to encourage site visitors to request and purchase an array of available design and development services. Once a user has purchased a product, they will be able to log
in via the email and password they provided at checkout and view the status of their work. The site owner will be able to upload the finished product via the website, which the customer will then
be able to either accept or request a round of changes. Once the customer has accepted, they will be invited to leave a testimonial which will display on the site.

## Wireframes

In order to visualise the project before creation, a series of wireframes were created. These outlined the basic structure of the site and the individual page layouts. Over the course of
the project, the designs evolved to meet the expanded scope, however the basic structure and design remained intact.

## Site Design

In order to draw focus to the work in the portfolio, the site will have a clean, minimalist design, encouraging white space where possible. This will be juxtaposed through the use of geometric
art, which is favoured by the site owner and used throughout his work.

### Colour Scheme

In keeping with the site logo, vibrant primary colours will be used alongside a white background to draw attention to the work. However, the site will not be limited to the use of primary colours
and will expand where necessary to encourage site users to view everything the site has to offer.

### Typography

To match the minimalistic design of the site, the Google Font [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?preview.text=Robert%20Clark%20Design&preview.text_type=custom) was used. This font
was selected to ensure user accessibility and readibility was always at the forefront of site design.

### Artwork

A strong focus on geometric design was used throughout the site, showcasing the site owner's penchant for the style. However, this was never limited to solely this style as the main purpose of the
site was to showcase a wide array of talent. This is never more prevalent than on the portfolio page, wherein the site user can view a range of the site owner's previous work.

# Features

## Existing Features

To realise the goals of the project, the following features were implemented:

`<-- TO FINISH -->`

### Home Page 

### About Page

### Portfolio Page

### Individual Project Page

### Testimonials Page

### Store Page

### Shopping Bag Page

### Checkout Page

### Log In Page

### Customer Project Page

### Contact Page


## Future Features To Implement

* The implementation of an inbuilt chat feature would add an extra layer of communication between site user and site owner. Users would be able to check in on the status of their project, and
request minor changes easily.

* Site users can sign in and create an account using their social media accounts such as Facebook or Instagram. This would allow a more seemless integration for users to register an account and
share work upon completion.

# Testing

## Bug Fixes

- During development of the bag app, an issue arose in which the plus and minus buttons to adjust quantity of an item in the bag didn't function properly. The script was implemented on the product_detail page,
wherein it worked perfectly fine, but the same could not be said for the bag page. As this was copied from the product_detail page, which in turn was near verbatim from the Boutique Ado walkthrough project, 
the code was studied and compared to that in the walkthrough. However there were no differences - aside from the exclusion of the sizing if else statement as no sizes were required on this project.
The fix came when the copied code from the product_detail page was deleted entirely, then rewritten manually from scratch. Though it was identical, to how it had been before, the code now worked.

- Checkout Webhook
During the creation of webhooks to ensure the Stripe payments would work as intended, a 500 error was being raised when a payment was submitted. Both the payment_intent.created and charge.succeeded went go through as intended, but the payment_intent.succeeded did not without manually resubmitting it in the Stripe dashboard. The terminal raised a ValueError saying the view checkout.webhooks.webhook didn’t return a HttpResponse object, and returned None instead. 
The issue came from the webhooks_handler.py file, which was missing a return at the end of the handle_payment_intent_succeeded function's else statement. Once this was included, the error was resolved.
